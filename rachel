Osquery is known to work on Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.
How it works

The osquery tool collects data from the system and makes them 
available as a database. By giving it database like queries you can 
extract data from the system and use that together with other tools.
Usage and audience

osquery is commonly used for compliance testing, information 
gathering, or security monitoring. Target users for this tool are auditors,
pentesters, security professionals, and system administrators.
